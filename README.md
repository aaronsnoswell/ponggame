# ponggame

A simple html5 pong game built for one of the Nexus ONE Youth websites by
[Aaron Snoswell](http://github.com/aaronsnoswell). Open Sourced in the
hope that someone might have some fun playing it, and perhaps even
learn something reading the source :)

It uses a simple canvas game engine, [jsge](https://github.com/aaronsnoswell/jsge)
(also developed by Aaron Snoswell).

Happy Coding!
